# examination system
A simple console-based student record management system written in C for university assignment.

📋 Project Overview
This program allows users to manage student records with features like adding, displaying, searching, and persisting data to files.

🎯 Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates:

Variables and Data Types (int, float, char arrays)
Control Structures (if-else statements, while loops, for loops)
Arrays (storing multiple students)
Functions (modular code organization)
Structures (grouping related data)
File Handling (saving and loading data)

🏗️ Program Structure
Student Structure
struct Student {
    char regNo[20];   // Registration number
    char name[30];    // Student name
    int age;          // Age
    float marks;      // Marks
};
Functions
addStudent() - Add a new student record
displayStudents() - Display all students in table format
searchStudent() - Search for a student by registration number
saveToFile() - Save records to students.txt
loadFromFile() - Load records from students.txt

🚀 How to Compile and Run
On Linux/macOS:
gcc student_system.c -o student_system
./student_system
On Windows:
gcc student_system.c -o student_system.exe
student_system.exe
📖 How to Use

Add Student: Enter registration number, name, age, and marks
Display Students: View all students in a formatted table
Search Student: Find a student by registration number
Save to File: Persist data to students.txt
Load from File: Retrieve previously saved data
Exit: Close the program

💡 Example Usage
===== STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM =====
1. Add Student
2. Display Students
3. Search Student
4. Save to File
5. Load from File
6. Exit
Enter choice: 1

--- Add Student ---
Enter Registration No: CS101
Enter Name: John
Enter Age: 20
Enter Marks: 85.5
Student added successfully!

📁 Files
student_system.c - Main source code
students.txt - Data file (created after first save)
README.md - This documentation

🔑 Key Concepts Explained
Pointers
Used in functions like addStudent(struct Student students[], int *count) to modify the original count variable.

String Comparison
Uses strcmp() from <string.h> to compare registration numbers (can't use == for strings in C).

File I/O
fopen() - Opens a file
fprintf() - Writes formatted data to file
fscanf() - Reads formatted data from file
fclose() - Closes the file
Arrays of Structures
struct Student students[100] creates an array that can hold up to 100 student records.

⚠️ Limitations
Maximum 100 students
Names cannot contain spaces (use underscore instead)
No data validation for negative ages or marks
🎓 Assignment Requirements Met
✅ Structure definition
✅ Array of structures
✅ Menu system with if-else
✅ All required functions implemented
✅ File handling (save/load)
✅ String comparison using strcmp()
